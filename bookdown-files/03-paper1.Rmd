## Paper 1

**Title:** Reference groups, perceived inequality and preferences for redistribution and welfare  

**Hypothesis for reference groups:**

Homophily

- isei_network (-) perc_ineq / deprivation
- diversity_network (-) perc_ineq / deprivation

- isei_network (-)  
- diversity_network (+) / basado en paper Londoño

Hypothesis of inequality experiences: 
- perc_ineq (+) / deprivation (+)

Hypothesis for networks and perceived inequality
- isei_network x perc_ineq (+)
- diversity_network x perc_ineq (+)

"en la medida que aumenta las experiencias negativas sobre la desigualdad el efecto positivo de la composición de la red debería fortalecerse"

"en la medida que aumenta las experiencias negativas sobre la desigualdad el efecto positivo de la diversidad de la red debería fortalecerse"

In study 1, I will address the claimed link between income inequality, social comparison and subjective social status

Individual level hypothesis:

> $H_1$: Higher perceived economic distance from the high-income reference group is associated with lower subjective status

Contextual level hypothesis:

> $H_2$: Income inequality is associated with lower subjective social status

Cross-level hypothesis

> $H_3$: Income inequality strengths the association of social comparison on subjective social status

In study 2, I will address the link between income inequality, subjective social status and redistributive preferences

Individual level hypothesis:

> $H_1$: Higher subjective social status is associated with lower redistributive preferences. This association will be stronger compared to income.

> $H_2$: The negative association of income will be stronger among low subjective status individuals.

Contextual level hypothesis:

> $H_3$: Income inequality increases redistributive preferences. Between-country will be more important than within-country effect.

Cross-level hypothesis:

> $H_4$: The association of subjective social status with redistributive preferences will be stronger in contexts of higher income inequality 

>  $H_5$: Among higher subjective and objective status individuals the support for redistribution will be higher for those in context with higher income inequality (objective and subjective altruism)
