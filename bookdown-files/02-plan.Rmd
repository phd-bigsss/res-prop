# Research plan  
## Overview {-}

Considering the theoretical and empirical elements presented above, I would like to contribute to the redistributive preference literature and discuss the role of social comparison as a relevant explanatory mechanism. As a result, my main research question is *What is the role of social comparison on redistributive preferences formation?*. In this respect, the first part of my research is to assess the relevance of subjective social status on redistributive preferences from a comparative perspective, considering that individuals' perception of their position in society can be understood as an outcome that derives from the social comparison that is also affected by a contextual characteristic such as objective income inequality at the country level. The second part of my research will address the role of social comparison experiences on policy preferences in cross-country comparison and employ national representative panel data. It is argued that levels of segregation at the country and community levels influence the frequency and salience of social comparison. As a result, contact with high-status groups will increment relative deprivation and demand for redistribution. The third part of my research will incorporate elements from the distributive justice literature to provide a complete image of the role of reference groups in social comparison and how these factors are associated with redistributive preferences. In this regard, evaluations are affected by observer's and observed characteristics, allowing us to estimate how these factors impact an outcome. Therefore, I propose a factorial design to assess the role vignette's attribute on the observer evaluation of the hypothetical individuals being affected by specific policies (e.g. increase taxes, health or unemployment benefits)
