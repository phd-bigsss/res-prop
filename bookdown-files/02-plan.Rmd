# Research plan  

Considering the theoretical and empirical elements presented above, I would like to contribute to the redistributive preference literature and discuss the role of social networks. As a result, my main research question is *What is the role of social networks on redistributive preferences?* and will be addressed in three independent studies. The Figure  \@ref(fig:theory-model)  represents the theoretical framework of the research project.

## Study 1 (S1)

**Economic inequality, social networks, and redistributive preferences: A cross-national study of 33 countries**

This study aims to assess the influence of network structure on redistributive preferences from a comparative perspective, employing secondary data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) 2017 -  "Social Networks and Social Resources" [@issp_research_group_international_2019]. This survey includes a version of the position generator, items on perceived economic inequality, and redistributive preferences. Therefore, this study clarifies the influence of contact diversity in social networks on increasing support for redistribution (H1). Second, to test if the influence of network diversity on redistributive preferences is mediated by perceived economic inequality (H2). Finally, to determine if current levels of economic inequality at the country level strengthen the influence of network diversity on redistributive preferences (H3). Multilevel regression models will be used for hypothesis testing to account for the data's hierarchical structure, including random slope estimations in the cross-level interactions.

## Study 2 (S2)

**Residential segregation, social networks and market distribution of social services: longitudinal evidence** 

In order to clarify causality assumptions, longitudinal studies can provide evidence in that direction. Consequently, this study aims to address how changes in network composition affect preferences for market distribution of social services (e.g. pensions, education, and health), employing national representative panel data from the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC) [@coes_estudio_2018]. First, in a similar approach to S1, it is expected that changes in network diversity have decreased the support for the market distribution of social services (H1). Second, the sampling design of the ELSOC allows testing hypotheses at the community level (*Municipalities*). Therefore, residential segregation is expected to increase preferences for marketization (H2) and strengthen the influence of network diversity on preferences (H3). Finally, in terms of empirical strategy, because repeated observations ($t$) are nested within individuals ($i$), which in turn belong to specific communities ($j$), a longitudinal multilevel strategy is the most suitable for modelling the data, assuming a three-level structure (observation-individual-community). 

## Study 3 (S3)

**Diversity, reference groups, and policy preferences: A vignette design**

The third part of my research will incorporate elements from the distributive justice literature to provide a complete image of the role of reference groups in redistributive preferences. In this regard, evaluations are affected by observer's and observed characteristics, allowing us to estimate how these factors impact an outcome. Therefore, I propose a factorial vignette design to assess the role vignette's attribute on the observer evaluation of the hypothetical individuals being affected or included by specific social policies (e.g. increased taxes, health or unemployment benefits).
