<!-- # Preferences and Economic Redistribution 
## Preference formation 

During the past decade, the research field of individual preferences toward economic redistribution constitute an interdisciplinary field in the social sciences [@alesina_preferences_2010;@steele_attitudes_2019]. In this regard, as a result of disciplinary boundaries, the phenomenon has been addressed through a range of concepts, such as _attitudes_ toward redistribution [@Garcia-Sanchez19], _social or welfare policy_ preferences [@breznau_economic_2010;@rehm_risk_2016] and _preferences, support or demand_ for redistribution [@steele_wealth_2022;@evans_strong_2018;@jaime-castillo_social_2019]. Across this body of literature, the common denominator is that individuals in society hold different views about what should be the role of government in taking measures for providing welfare and to what extent this role has to be accomplished. In order to establish boundaries and properly conceptualize this phenomenon, we need to review previous discussions in the literature. 

The theoretical framework proposed by @Janmaat2013 distinguishes between the concepts of perceptions, beliefs and judgments about economic inequality. First, perceptions refer to subjective descriptive estimations, in other words, how individuals think existing inequality is. Second, beliefs are understood as the normative dimension regarding how income distribution should be, acquired through socialisation processes. Finally, judgments are considered as the normative evaluation of the existing inequality, referring to what extent it is considered good or desired [@Janmaat2013,p.4]. Within this framework, the concept of preference is occasionally misled with beliefs or judgments. In this regard, is relevant to point out that the ideas about how the object (e.g. inequality) should be, do not explicitly consider its' evaluation. In this line, the concept of preference needs to be distinguished from the previous framework, because the phenomenon studied in the redistributive preferences literature refers to the subjective appraisal regarding measures (e.g. social policies) to afront the existing levels of inequality. 

Another approach for the study preferences has been developed by @druckman_preference_2000. On their view, the formation of preferences can be understood as the combination of internal and external dynamics, suggesting that preferences derive from the evaluation of an external object and its' attributes relative to another (e.g. public policy). Objects can be observable physically continuous phenomena (e.g. furniture) and unobservable, physically discontinuous phenomena (e.g. shared ideas) [@druckman_preference_2000,p.4]. In addition, individuals evaluate based on beliefs that are linked to the description of an object's attributes, which are in turn built on top of previous information acquired by the exposure to the stimuli of the environment, in other words, by experience [@druckman_preference_2000,p.5]. 

Both approaches mentioned constitute an insightful understanding of what preferences are and how they are formed. Nevertheless, there is a difference that needs to be clarified. On the one hand, Janmaat's [-@Janmaat2013] approach allows distinguishing the descriptive from the normative dimension in the study of subjective inequality but is less clear toward the concept of preferences. In this regard, I argue that preference formation does have a normative dimension, but it is not purely based on it. Therefore it is necessary to consider external influences. On the other hand, @druckman_preference_2000 don not explicitly consider preferences to be linked with norms. They suggest that preferences are the function of beliefs, and the latter are systematically formed through experience. In this regard, preferences are the manifestation of an object evaluation, which is ranked by an observer on top of the description of its attributes. In my view, both approaches share the assumption about preference formation is not entirely neither internal nor external to the individual. In other words, both approaches agree that the descriptive dimension comprises the foundations for further evaluations which consequently lead to the formation of preferences. 

The crucial point in which both approaches differ is how they define *beliefs*. For @Janmaat2013 beliefs are less contingent, in order that they are linked to social norms, but for @druckman_preference_2000 due to beliefs being a function of perception, they are more dynamic and susceptible to being updated by external shocks (e.g. information) [@druckman_preference_2000, p. 6]. In this regard, I argue that adopting *beliefs* as a concept can be problematic, due to the different meanings that the literature has used for the study of preferences. These differences could lead to conceptual inconsistencies, wrong assumptions about causality and erroneous theoretical conclusions. 

As an alternative to the unclear use of beliefs, the literature has developed the concept of *values* as a more accurate representation of the normative dimension [@feldman_humanitarian_2001]. From this perspective, the internalisation of social norms is tightly linked with socialisation processes and represents a less contingent and stable characteristic  [@min_intergenerational_2012]. Social norms represent the pursued societal rules and goals, which are rationalised as individual motivation for action [@breznau_economic_2010]. Values can be expressed by particular views, for example, about the distribution of economic opportunities and resources or to what extent humans share certain universal attributes that make them deserve to be recipients of welfare (for details see section [3.1](#normative)).  

**Summary**

For studying preferences, it is crucial to have a clear conceptual framework to address. The proposed framework is composed of four core elements: Information, Perception, Values and Judgment. Figure \@ref(fig:preferences) depicts the conceptual distinction between these elements, but also an attempt to synthesise the approaches reviewed above. Following @druckman_preference_2000, *Information* constitutes the external *stimuli* which contribute to the reference framework employed by individuals to describe the attributes of an object, which is in turn understood as *Perception* (how *is*). In this regard, an assumption is that perceptions can change and it relies on the possibility of partially updating current information. Aside from the environmental exposure and the descriptive dimension, there are internal normative structures that are expressed by *Values*. In this line, I argue that contingent *Information* does not play an important role in values because ideas that have been acquired in socialisation processes do not experience relevant changes and tend to be more consistent on time. The fourth element synthesises the influence of the previous. However, it goes a step forward considering *Judgment* as the evaluative process that emerges on top of the description and the normative views around the attributes of an object that lead to consider it as desirable (or not), remaining latent until it can become observable as a revealed *Preference* under a certain situation which demands a manifestation of it.

## Redistribution: what, how and who 

How the redistributive preferences literature has addressed the phenomena, apart from the previous distinction in preference formation, it is important to point out how preferences have been conceptualised across the literature. Previously, we have mentioned that disciplinary boundaries influenced the denomination of the phenomena. Despite this, this section presents three of the main conceptual approaches that have been empirically discussed across the literature. 

Preferences can be approached according to how concrete the attributes of the evaluated object are. One way to empirically addressed preferences for redistribution is the reduction of economic inequality which refers to what extent individuals believe that the government should be responsible for the reduction of the income gap between rich and poor, which has become one of the most common approaches for the study of preferences in the literature. For example, based on the General Social Survey @alesina_preferences_2010 analyse the evaluation of citizens about the role of government in Washington in improving the standard of living of all poor or if they should take care of themselves. From a cross-national approach, using data from the World Value Survey the @alesina_preferences_2010 analysed to what degree citizens believe that welfare should be the responsibility of individuals or that the government should provide universal support. On the same line, @Garcia-Sanchez19 scrutinise to what extent individuals agree that the government is responsible for reducing the differences between high and low incomes by employing the International Social Survey Programme. Looking at regional comparisons, @jaime-castillo_social_2019 examined European citizens' opinions on the idea that government should take measures to reduce income differences by employing the European Social Survey. Finally, @franetovic_preferences_2022 compared Latin American countries using the Latinobarometer survey, analysing to what extent subjects agree that government should implement policies to reduce income inequality between rich and poor. Overall, these cases briefly describe how the literature has empirically addressed general preferences for redistribution without addressing specific welfare policies.    

Another dimension of redistributive preferences is how individuals rationalize the link between tax policy and economic inequality. In this regard, there is research that has employed the concept of preferences for progressive taxation as a way to study redistributive preferences. The argument is that the link between income and welfare is increasingly relevant in societies with a progressive tax regime in which households on the top of the income distribution are those who contribute more and get directly benefited less by redistribution in which the core assumption that links income and redistributive preferences relies on what extent individuals prefer a progressive tax policy [@cansunar_who_2021,p.1]. However, empirical findings have shown that even the more affluent are more willing to support progressive taxation when they perceive that someone is richer than them [@cansunar_who_2021]. In addition, other evidence has shown that even against their material interest, low-income individuals support regressive tax cuts as a result of their perceived own tax burden, but also due to a lack of political information [@bartels_homer_2005].

Finally, another body of literature has addressed preferences for redistribution based on the evaluation of certain social policies (e.g. unemployment benefits or health insurance). In this line, the individuals or groups that potentially become recipients of these welfare policies can be conceptually distinguished between those who are directly affected by policies in the short term (e.g. the poor or unemployed) [@Aaroe2014] and those who are going to be affected by them, potentially or directly, in the future (e.g. ill or retired) [@castillo_deserving_2019;@rehm_risk_2016]. In this regard, how the government enacts welfare policies also considers the characteristics of the recipients of the benefits. This subject has been addressed by the deservingness heuristic approach, which adverts to what extent a certain group or individuals are considered to be within the scope of benefits of a certain welfare policy [@Jensen2017]. Therefore, it has been argued that public preferences toward redistributive social policies represent the evaluation of the policy, taking into account to what extent it affects the present (or future) material interest of the evaluator (e.g. income tax rise), but also the attributes of the recipients of the enacted policy [@garcia-sanchez_two_2022]. 

**Summary**

Overall, two main dimensions of redistributive preferences have been addressed empirically in the literature. However, this exercise has its problems, as there is a clear distinction between an *abstract* willingness to increase redistribution and a *concrete* preference for specific redistributive measures. Regarding redistribution in the abstract, the idea that some entity (e.g. the government) should be responsible for reducing economic inequalities represents an abstract understanding of redistribution because it does not specify how this should be done, under what conditions, or who the beneficiaries are [@garcia-sanchez_two_2022, p. 3]. This approach can be problematic because it can be argued that it captures a general preference for economic inequality, that may not be consistently linked with concrete policies [@steele_wealth_2022, p. 8]. Nevertheless, the limitations of this approach do not imply that is not possible to adopt it but is crucial to clarify that it represents no more than general preferences toward redistribution.

On the side of redistribution in concrete, there are at least two domains. One is the goals and scope of the tax regime, and the other is the provision of social welfare. In this line, @mccall_americans_2009 suggest that redistribution in practices can be addressed by rising taxes for those with higher incomes and by increasing public transfers for those in need. However, they consider that demands for governmental action are not necessarily linked to redistributive preferences, but public spending on welfare policies. Given this evidence, it might be correct to treat them as independent public opinion phenomena. However, a less discussed aspect in the literature is to what extent individuals link taxation with the provision of public welfare, but also the factors that could intervene in this association. -->

<!-- Preferences for redistribution can be understood as the individual's evaluation towards the role of government in managing the economic distribution on top of their actual perceptions and information. Furthermore, preferences are influenced by the attributes of governmental actions that are represented by public policies. Hence, preferences can be addressed through the evaluation of government responsibility for the reduction of economic inequality globally, by focusing on the characteristics of a concrete welfare policy or through the modification of the tax regime. -->

A less discussed issue in the preferences literature is the empirical relationship between taxes and redistribution.

Another aspect is the specific object, in this case, policies that are being evaluated by the observator.

A theoretical relevant aspect of how to understand this phenomenon is to disentangle the underlying dimensions that comprise it.
