# Introduction 

How individuals perceive the world around them has been a central issue in sociology and social psychology. In this regard, the literature on preference formation suggests that these rely on normative structures such as values, ideological or political conceptions about the world [@smithCulturalValuesModerate2018; @Janmaat2013]. 

In addition, the theoretical and empirical development in sociological social justice research has focused on the role of situations and societal context over justice evaluations and distributive preferences [@Liebig-Sauer2016].
