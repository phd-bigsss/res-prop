<!-- # Self-interest and material reality

The literature has pointed out the objective position as one of the main drivers of preferences for redistribution. As an extension of the median voter theorem, the Meltzer & Richard model [@Meltzer81] proposed economic self-interest as an explanatory mechanism for redistributive preferences. The model proposes income as the representation of voters' material interests expressed by their preferences as the function of the distance from the income median, where those below it hold higher preferences for redistribution compared with those above. In other words, those at the bottom benefit more from redistribution and are less affected by tax burden increases compared to those close to the top of the income distribution.  

## Income, wealth and future income {-}

The negative influence of economic self-interest on redistributive preferences has been widely documented in the literature. Evidence from the United States [@alesina_preferences_2010], Europe [@dimick_models_2018] and Latin America [@franetovic_preferences_2022] has supported the predictions of the theory. However, despite evidence favouring the self-interest hypothesis, recent studies have shown mixed evidence regarding the adverse preferences of high-income groups and the role of market income as the primary driver of self-interest. For example, a recent study on urban Brazilian citizens found a positive influence of income on redistributive preferences [@garcia-sanchez_creencias_2022]. The authors suggest higher awareness regarding income inequality among affluent and educated individuals in an unequal context like Brazil, which makes them express altruistic views about inequality and support higher redistribution. Furthermore, although cross-national comparisons have shown the expected negative association, there are also null and positive effects of income among different redistributive domains, demonstrating that adverse preferences among the rich are inconsistent across societies [@steele_wealth_2022, pp.10-13]. In this regard, the authors point out wealth as an alternative and more stable source of self-interest than market income.

The role of wealth has yet to be discussed in the redistributive preferences literature. @steele_wealth_2020 argued that wealth could constitute a more comprehensive aspect of studying economic resources. At the same time, it encompasses the totality of assets, which can be subdivided into "housing wealth", representing ownership of a dwelling and other types of property such as land or vehicles. In addition, there are financial assets, such as savings accounts or shares in the financial market, that can be understood as "financial wealth" [@steele_wealth_2020,p.2]. Using cross-national data from the International Social Survey (ISSP onwards), @steele_wealth_2020 found higher relative importance of financial wealth than housing wealth. The author argues in favour of disaggregating both sources of wealth suggesting financial assets are often easily translated to liquid rather than housing wealth commonly linked to mortgages and does not provide a direct income source. Thus, in contrast with market income, housing and financial wealth have an independent positive but heterogeneous influence on country redistributive preferences. Similarly, @steele_wealth_2022 took a deeper look into the influence of both wealth dimensions demonstrating that financial wealth has a stronger association among Nordic societies, arguing that income inequality in these countries is one of the lowest in the globe. Therefore wealth inequality could be more salient than income when individuals express their preferences. Furthermore, it is argued that wealth is related to a "safety net" effect. In other words, it provides economic security in the form of inheritance for the next generation, protects them from economic shocks (e.g. unemployment), and enhances life chances [@steele_wealth_2022,p.4].

@rueda_who_2019 have argued that most material self-interest literature focused on market income, but the relative importance of income prospects has yet to be explored appropriately. In other words, the analysis of the self-interest mechanism should not be limited to a measure of current income but also pay attention to life course events and their potential consequences on _future_ material conditions. Their argument relies on the Mincer earnings function, where income returns are a function of human capital and experience in the labour market [@rueda_who_2019, p.42]. However, the proposed influence of future income relies on the assumption that individuals _know_ about the life cycle of people from their same educational group. Thus, knowledge about income prospects can negatively influence actual preferences for redistribution. First, they demonstrate that actual and expected income were not highly correlated, in favour of their expectation about the independency of the effect of both on redistributive preferences. Second, their analysis using European cross-sectional and panel survey data confirm that the robust effect of future income undermines preferences for redistribution.

The contributions on the role of wealth and future income point out the importance of time-varying individual characteristics but also turn our attention to long-term changes like intergenerational transmission of advantages and social mobility. In this vein, there is an important body of literature on the role of social mobility (actual or expected) on preferences for redistribution. In the following section, I will revise recent evidence in this respect.   

## Social mobility {-}

How social mobility influences preferences for redistribution has been influenced by disciplinary boundaries in the social sciences. For example, sociologists have focused on intergenerational social mobility employing occupational class schemes to analyse individual changes in labour market positions compared with the previous generation [@Connelly2016;@Erikson1992], while economics has paid more attention to income mobility [@alesina_intergenerational_2018]. Research on the subjective dimension of social mobility has also been developed during the last years, focusing on the influence of perceived economic situation compared to previous generations [@mijs_belief_2022]. The redistributive preferences literature has conceived social mobility as a factor able to boost self-interest via two situational mechanisms. On the one side, experienced intergenerational upward (downward) mobility is associated with lower (higher) demand for redistributive measures. On the other side, it is expected that prospects of upward mobility in the future, or for future generations, undermine redistributive preferences.

Evidence from the United States has shown that intergenerational occupational upward mobility increases redistributive preferences, compared with the null effect of educational mobility [@alesina_preferences_2010]. Similarly, evidence from European countries using diagonal reference models for social class mobility has shown lower preferences for redistribution for upward-mobile individuals [@jaime-castillo_social_2019]. In the same vein, a study of Latin American countries demonstrates that upward educational mobility has a robust positive influence on preferences redistribution and privatisation of public services [@gavira_social_2008]. Overall, cross-national and single-case studies have shown evidence of the unique explanatory capacity of having experienced upward social mobility through education and occupational class. However, it has been illustrated by the literature on subjective inequality that perception plays a crucial role in how individuals rationalise their origin and destination positions.  

Studies have demonstrated that higher subjective social mobility increases the willingness to justify the system [@Day2017] and boosts acceptance of economic inequality [@fehr_social_2020]. A cross-national study found evidence in favour of the positive link of occupational and educational mobility on perceived social mobility but also demonstrated that perceived mobility weakens the effect of objective mobility on higher wage inequality justification [@kelley_subjective_2008]. A recent study in five western societies has shown that Europeans are more pessimistic about social mobility than Americans. Still, also their experimental results demonstrate that manipulation of perceived income mobility with pessimistic information increases support for redistribution, mainly through equality of opportunities policies [@alesina_intergenerational_2018].

Current or perceived levels of social mobility in society can influence the expectations about mobility prospects. In this regard, @benabou_social_2001 have formalised the prospective upward mobility hypothesis (POUM) as an extension of the median voter model, where even those below the income median can develop adverse preferences toward redistribution, assuming that progressive taxes can negatively affect them due to their expectations of achieve incomes above the median. Empirical evidence has demonstrated that expectations about upward social mobility are associated with lower support for redistribution. For instance, using a sample of Italian students, the experimental manipulation of mobility prospects increases the demand for redistribution, being more salient among middle and lower-income individuals [@Filippin2003]. Another study in Spain demonstrates that redistributive preferences decline among individuals with subjective income expectations above the median and higher perceived meritocracy [@Jaime-Castillo2008]. On another approach, among Latin American countries, higher expectations about the next generation's educational achievement diminish support for redistribution [@gavira_social_2008]. Using expected subjective well-being as a proxy of future economic security, @fong_prospective_2006 demonstrates that well-being prospects decrease support for redistribution but also discusses the negative influence of internal poverty attribution (e.g. laziness).   

## Risk and externalities {-}

Present or current individual situations do not entirely guide redistributive preferences. Therefore, expectations about potential adverse outcomes in the future can influence support for redistribution, which the literature has addressed through the concept of risk exposure. The concept is commonly defined as the chances of experiencing shocks across the life course that can undermine economic security and welfare [@rehm_risk_2016]. Welfare state literature on the field has linked risk in two veins. One part of the literature has pointed out labour market outcomes focusing on individual unemployment risk [@rehm_risks_2009]. Another body of literature has focused on deservingness heuristics, pointing out that the risk of being affected by random events, such as sickness-based needs, could motivate higher demands for health or unemployment welfare [@Jensen&Nauman2016]. 

The literature has demonstrated that unemployment increases demand for redistribution and social insurance [@steele_wealth_2020;@alesina_preferences_2010]. In this line, the argument for studying risk from a labour market approach relies on potential outcomes, not current employment status, where the odds of losing the current market income can raise the demand for redistributive policies. Another dimension of the link of unemployment risk is to what extent national redistribution can compensate for the adverse employment impacts of globalisation on particular economic sectors, arguing that a more significant influence of international trade is associated with higher demand for redistribution [@rehm_risks_2009,p.6]. However, empirical evidence has shown only an increment in redistributive claims for higher occupational risk at the individual level but null evidence in favour of the compensation effect by the economic sector [@rehm_risks_2009]. Similarly, @Svallfors2006 has argued that labour market position provides information about work conditions and wages. Thus, it has been shown that lower incomes and, consequently, higher labour market risk among the lower classes are associated with higher demand for redistribution [@Svallfors2006]. Furthermore, a recent study has claimed automation as another source of risk, demonstrating higher levels of support for redistribution among lower-skilled workers with higher automation rates [@hoorn_automatability_2022].   

Social insurance demand through health-related policies has also been linked with risk exposure. The argument is that random shocks across the life course can increase the demand for redistribution [@alesina_preferences_2010,p.18]. However, the support for specific policies is influenced by their content and affected target groups [@moene_inequality_2001]. For instance, a cross-national study has shown that higher incomes increase the demand for governmental responsibility on health welfare, also a higher willingness to pay taxes for improving the health care system, but a null association with higher social spending for preventive medical check-ups [@Azaretal2018]. Also, another research demonstrates that a higher unemployment risk increases the willingness to pay taxes for universal healthcare in 28 countries [@Maldonadoetal2019]. In addition, it has been demonstrated welfare system can influence the link between unemployment risk and health policy preferences, where high levels of health system privatisation lead to less demand for healthcare spending to be negatively influenced by unemployment risk [@zhu_policy_2015].    

The influence of income inequality on demand for insurance is not entirely related to labour market outcomes. The literature has discussed how concerns about the negative consequences of inequality can trigger insurance motivation. In this regard, altruism has been proposed as an explanatory mechanism that links inequality with redistributive preferences of the top income groups [@dimick_models_2018]. It has been argued that negative externalities of income inequality on social welfare can motivate normative-driven altruistic preferences from affluent individuals [@dimick_models_2018]. Altruism relies on both individual and social utility of social welfare as desirable, assuming concerns about inequality as the normative foundation of altruistic preferences by the rich. Evidence from European societies has confirmed the theory's claims, demonstrating an increase in redistributive preferences among the rich in highly unequal contexts, in contrast with the rich in lower inequality contexts [@rueda_who_2019;@dimick_models_2018]. A recent study has also found evidence in favour of the theory in Latin American countries [@franetovic_preferences_2022, p.15]. On the same line, derived from the altruistic model, it has been argued that crime as a negative externality can increase insurance demands [@rueda_who_2019, p.86]. In this regard, more significant concerns about crime can motivate altruistic behaviour from the rich for high public spending to mitigate crime rates as negative externalities. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that higher fear of crime or being a victim of crime in the past increases redistributive preferences [@rueda_who_2019, p. 113]. Then, the evidence shows that higher preferences among the rich can be explained through concerns about crime in highly unequal contexts [@rueda_who_2019, p. 128] 

# Norms and values
Social norms constitute a crucial factor for studying social order and behaviour [@esser_integrative_2015], but also provide an interpretative frame for understanding social welfare institutions [@esping-andersen_three_1990]. The literature on redistributive preferences has addressed this domain as an independent source of motivation for individual preferences as an alternative approach to the material self-interest explanations. Inspired by the sociological theory of action, @esser_integrative_2015 suggest that the _homo economicus_ or utilitarian paradigm focuses on opportunities, incentives, and rational expectations as an explanation of human behaviour following the self-interest mechanism. On the other hand, from the _homo sociologicus_ or normative paradigm, institutionalised rules of action are learned through socialisation and internalisation processes. Therefore,  human behaviour will unconditionally be influenced by normative appraisals. A third approach is the interpretative paradigm, which seeks to synthesise rational and normative approaches to develop a situational-dependent model of action based on frame selection [@esser_integrative_2015, p. 69-80]. Frames are ideal-typical situations based on previous experiences that can provide meaning to the evaluated situation, which can activate two possible modes: automatic-spontaneous (as) or reflecting-calculating (rc). The as-mode is strongly influenced by previous experience, and choice selection tends to be less reflexive. In contrast, the rc-mode considers several alternatives where uncertainty and future consequences activate moral evaluations. Thus, a framework where actions are guided by weighting utilitarian and normative evaluations can serve as an explanatory frame for variations in redistributive preferences.

The literature on preference for redistribution has addressed the influence of normative factors under the concept of _values_, but some research has used _beliefs_ or _ideology_ interchangeably. However, political psychology and political science literature have suggested that values differ conceptual and empirically from the left-right continuum commonly used to study political ideology, arguing that egalitarian values can be shared by people on different political spectrum points [@feldman_understanding_2014]. The literature on social welfare preferences has discussed the role of egalitarian or humanitarian values as sources of normative motivations for redistribution. @feldman_humanitarian_2001 have argued that egalitarianism is related to the justice principle of equality and associated with higher support for government intervention in social and economic spheres. At the same time, humanitarianism is considered a prosocial orientation close to the justice principle of need and is commonly associated with poverty relief or health policies [@feldman_humanitarian_2001, p. 5]. 

Egalitarian values are expected to be associated with higher support for redistribution. For example, distributive justice literature has shown that lower justification of economic inequality is associated with stronger egalitarianism [@Castillo2011;@Castillo2012b_multidimentional]. Furthermore, a study of six western industrialised societies demonstrated that higher attachment to egalitarian values is strongly associated with support for government involvement in social services, price controls and basic needs subsidies [@breznau_economic_2010]. In a similar vein, a study on European countries shows that egalitarianism increases demand for progressive taxation and government social spending [@svallfors_government_2013]. Furthermore, evidence from European countries has shown a stronger association of egalitarianism with policy preference among higher-class individuals, arguing that higher economic risk can weaken the link between abstract human values and redistribution [@Kulin2013]. Also, the relation of egalitarianism has been addressed in health policy preferences, where higher egalitarianism predicts higher support for public health provision and higher social spending on preventive health but null support for progressive taxation for health policies [@Azaretal2018]. 

On the side of humanitarian values, evidence has shown that among American citizens, those with stronger humanitarian values tend to support policies focused on elderly needs and poverty relief [@feldman_humanitarian_2001]. The authors argue that humanitarian values are not blind to social inequality but rationalise social problems as part of the human condition. Regardless of the shared concerns about the justice of humanitarian and egalitarian approaches, the focus on needs by humanitarian values leads to support of specific policies rather than redistribution as a measure to accomplish the principle of equality. In this vein, a cross-national study of 28 countries has demonstrated that a solid attachment to humanitarian values is associated with a higher willingness to pay taxes for universal health care but also moderate the negative influence of risk exposure [@Maldonadoetal2019]. -->
